1. Generate continuous time signals x(t) and y(t) for t = 0 to 10 in steps of 0.01. Try with periodic as well as non-periodic signals.

2. Use the the "fft" function to take the Fourier Transform of your signals. Let us call it x_fft and y_fft. Try with 4 different FFT sizes - 256-point FFT, 512-point FFT, 1024-point FFT and 2048-point FFT.

Case 1: If the length of your signal is less than FFT size, pad with zeros.
Case 2: If the length of your signal is less, take only the first N points of your signal for taking the N-size FFT.
Plot the magnitude and phase of x_fft and y_fft. What do you observe in both the cases?

3. Now use "ifft" to take the inverse Fourier Transform. Did you get back the original signal in both the cases? Justify your answer.

4. Verify linearity, time-shift, convolution, real/imaginary even/odd properties. Do these properties hold in both Case 1 and Case 2? Justify your answers.
