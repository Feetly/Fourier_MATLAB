Fourier Transforms on MATLAB:

1. Checking Even/Odd functions.
2. PLoting Even/Odd parts of any function.
3. Convolution using user-made function.
4. Ploting fft and ifft of functions.
5. Verification of linearity, time-shift, convolution, real/imaginary even/odd properties of a continuous time varying signal using fft and ifft methods.
